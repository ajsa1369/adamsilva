- Verify JavaScript isn't dynamically changing canonical

**If Grok citations don't appear:**
- Verify X Premium is active
- Check Grokbot in robots.txt
- Confirm 3-5 posts per week on X
- Engage more with AI/marketing community

**If Request Indexing is grayed out:**
- Daily quota hit (10-12 URLs/day)
- Wait 24 hours and try again

1. **Layer GEO on top of SEO** - Don't replace, enhance
2. **Focus on E-E-A-T signals** - Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust
3. **Update statistics quarterly** - Fresh data = better citations
4. **Build genuine community presence** - Don't just promote
