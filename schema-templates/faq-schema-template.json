        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of optimizing content so AI platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Grok and Google AI Overviews cite your expertise in generated responses. GEO focuses on citation-worthy content structure, authority signals, and conversational formatting rather than traditional keyword rankings."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "GEO prioritizes being cited in AI-generated answers rather than ranking in search results. While SEO focuses on keywords and backlinks, GEO emphasizes structured data, conversational content, statistics with citations, expert quotes, and clear fact-density that AI can confidently extract and attribute."
