    question: "What is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?",
    answer: "Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of optimizing content to be cited by AI-powered answer engines like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google AI. Unlike traditional SEO which focuses on ranking in search results, AEO focuses on being the authoritative source that AI engines cite when answering user questions. At Adam Silva Consulting, we specialize in AEO strategies that ensure your business becomes the go-to source for AI-generated answers in your industry."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?",
    answer: "Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the optimization of content and digital presence for generative AI engines that create custom, contextual responses. GEO involves structuring your information architecture, content, and metadata so that AI models can easily extract, understand, and synthesize your content when generating responses. This includes optimizing for citation accuracy, context preservation, and topical authority signals that AI engines use to determine source credibility."
  },
  {
    question: "How is AEO different from traditional SEO?",
    answer: "Traditional SEO optimizes for visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs) and focuses on keywords, backlinks, and technical optimization. AEO optimizes for being cited as a source by AI engines and focuses on content structure, authority signals, and answer-worthy content. Modern digital marketing requires both: SEO for traditional search visibility, AEO for AI engine citations, and GEO for generative AI responses. At Adam Silva Consulting, we integrate all three approaches for comprehensive digital authority."
  },
  {
    question: "Who should invest in AEO and GEO services?",

This includes B2B companies, professional services firms, technology companies, consultants, and thought leaders who want to be cited by AI engines like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity. If your customers or prospects are asking AI engines questions related to your expertise, you need AEO to ensure your business is cited in those responses."
