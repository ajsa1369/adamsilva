# IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN: Request Google Reindexing

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Manual Steps Required

Google Search Console API doesn't support automated reindexing requests. You must manually request indexing for each URL using the Google Search Console interface.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Verify the Fix is Live (Do This First!)
1. Open your website: https://www.adamsilvaconsulting.com/
2. Right-click and select "View Page Source"
3. Search for `rel="canonical"` (Ctrl+F / Cmd+F)
4. Confirm it shows: `<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.adamsilvaconsulting.com/" />`
5. Confirm there's NO reference to `vjw8elsw2jmo.space.minimax.io`

If the fix is not live yet, wait for your deployment to complete (usually 5-10 minutes).

### Step 2: Request Indexing for Priority Pages
Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console

For each URL below, follow these steps:
1. Paste the URL into the top search bar
2. Click "Test Live URL" (wait for the test to complete)
3. Click "Request Indexing"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes before doing the next URL (to avoid rate limits)

**Priority URLs (Do these first):**
```
https://www.adamsilvaconsulting.com/
https://www.adamsilvaconsulting.com/services
https://www.adamsilvaconsulting.com/about
https://www.adamsilvaconsulting.com/contact
https://www.adamsilvaconsulting.com/blog
```

### Step 3: Request Indexing for All Other Pages
After completing the priority pages, request indexing for the remaining pages. You can typically request indexing for 10-12 URLs per day to avoid rate limits.

**All URLs to Request Indexing (51 total):**

#### Main Pages (6 URLs)
```

### Step 4: Monitor Progress
Check your Google Search Console daily:

1. **Coverage Report**: 
   - Go to: Coverage > Excluded
   - Watch for "Alternate page with proper canonical tag" to decrease
   - Watch for indexed pages to increase

2. **URL Inspection**:
   - Spot-check a few URLs you've submitted
   - Confirm "User-declared canonical" shows correct URL
   - Confirm "Google-selected canonical" matches your canonical

3. **Search Analytics**:
   - Watch for impressions and clicks to start appearing
   - Usually takes 3-7 days after indexing

### Step 5: Bulk Monitoring Script
To check which pages are indexed, you can use this search in Google:
```
site:adamsilvaconsulting.com
```

This shows how many pages Google has indexed. Track this number daily.

## Expected Timeline
- **Day 1-2**: Request indexing for priority pages
- **Day 3-7**: Request indexing for remaining pages (10-12 per day)
- **Day 7-14**: Google recrawls and reindexes pages
- **Day 14-30**: Search rankings begin to recover
- **Day 30-60**: Full SEO recovery

## Troubleshooting

### If Pages Still Show Wrong Canonical After 48 Hours:
1. Check if your site has a CDN or proxy that might be caching old content
2. Check your hosting provider's cache settings
3. Clear your CDN cache (Cloudflare, etc.)

### If Request Indexing is Grayed Out:
- You've hit the daily quota (10-12 URLs per day)
- Wait 24 hours and try again

### If Google Still Shows Old Canonical After Recrawl:
- Check your server headers for canonical tags
- Verify no JavaScript is dynamically changing canonical
- Check robots.txt isn't blocking Googlebot

## Need Help?
If you encounter issues:
1. Check the SEO_FIX_OCTOBER_2025.md document
2. Review Google Search Console's help documentation
3. Contact your hosting provider if cache issues persist
