## Common Questions

### What is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?
AEO is the practice of optimizing content to be cited by AI-powered answer engines like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google AI. Unlike traditional SEO which focuses on ranking in search results, AEO focuses on being the source that AI engines cite when answering user questions.

### What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?
GEO is the optimization of content for generative AI engines that create custom responses. It involves structuring information so that AI models can easily extract, understand, and cite your content when generating responses.

SEO optimizes for traditional search engine rankings. AEO optimizes for being cited by AI engines. GEO optimizes for generative AI responses. Modern businesses need all three for complete visibility.
