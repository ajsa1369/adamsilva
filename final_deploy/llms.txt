## AGENTIC COMMERCE PROTOCOLS

Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP):
Google's open standard launched January 2026, co-developed with Shopify, Walmart, Target, Etsy, and 20+ partners. Enables AI agents to discover merchant capabilities via machine-readable manifests at /.well-known/ucp. Adam Silva Consulting implements UCP for full agent discovery compatibility.

Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP):
OpenAI and Stripe's framework enabling Instant Checkout in ChatGPT. Uses Shared Payment Tokens (SPT) for secure agent-initiated transactions. We implement ACP adapters for ChatGPT commerce compatibility.

Agent Payments Protocol (AP2):
Google's cryptographically-signed mandate system providing verifiable proof of user authorization. Uses ECDSA signatures and Verifiable Credentials for Intent Mandates, Cart Mandates, and Payment Mandates. We implement AP2 infrastructure for trustworthy autonomous transactions.

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE EXPERTISE

SPA + SSR Implementation:
Single Page Applications with Server-Side Rendering delivering sub-300ms render times that AI agents prioritize. Eliminates the "Hydration Tax" of legacy platforms.

Token Efficiency Optimization:
Architectures designed for AI crawler token budgets, maximizing meaningful content per token parsed. Sites we build achieve 3-5x higher AI citation rates.

Heavy Schema Markup:
Comprehensive JSON-LD implementation including Product, Service, Organization, Person, FAQPage, HowTo, and custom entity graphs that AI systems can reliably parse.

## KEY CONCEPTS & DEFINITIONS

Agentic Commerce:
The paradigm shift where AI agents discover, negotiate, and execute purchases on behalf of users. Defined by UCP (discovery), ACP (execution), and AP2 (trust).

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO):
Optimizing content to be cited by AI engines like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity when they directly answer queries—not just ranked in search results.

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO):
Structuring content so large language models accurately understand, extract, and synthesize information when generating responses.

Token Efficiency:
The ratio of meaningful content to total parsing cost for AI crawlers. Higher efficiency means agents prioritize your content.

Hydration Tax:
The computational cost and latency of legacy platforms' JavaScript-heavy architectures that waste AI agents' token budgets.

Heavy Schema Markup:
Comprehensive JSON-LD structured data defining all entities, relationships, and properties in machine-readable format for AI comprehension.

Intent Mandate (AP2):
Cryptographically-signed proof of user authorization for agent-initiated transactions, including spending limits, conditions, and TTL.

Cart Mandate (AP2):
Two-way cryptographic commitment locking exact items, prices, and fulfillment terms between user and merchant.
