# Deployment Fix Guide for Adam Silva Consulting

## Issue Identified
The website was incorrectly configured as a Next.js application on Vercel, but it's actually a React + Vite SPA. This caused routing issues where direct URLs like `/contact` returned 404 errors.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated package.json
- Removed Next.js dependencies and scripts
- Added correct Vite + React dependencies
- Fixed build scripts to use Vite

### 2. Fixed vercel.json
- Removed incorrect build configuration
- Added proper SPA routing fallback
- Configured correct output directory (`dist`)
- Added proper cache headers

### 3. Removed _redirects file
- This file is for Netlify, not Vercel
- Vercel uses `vercel.json` for routing configuration

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Update deployment config for React+Vite SPA"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger Vercel redeploy:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Find your project
   - Click "Redeploy" to trigger a new deployment

3. **Verify the fix:**
   - Test https://www.adamsilvaconsulting.com (should work)
   - Test https://www.adamsilvaconsulting.com/contact (should now work)
   - Test other routes like /services, /insights, etc.

## Expected Result
After deployment, all direct URLs should work correctly:
- ✅ https://www.adamsilvaconsulting.com/contact
- ✅ https://www.adamsilvaconsulting.com/services  
- ✅ https://www.adamsilvaconsulting.com/insights
- ✅ All other routes
